# Chain multiple UIView animations, the easy way

Superfluous animations, I love them. For [OK Video](https://okvideo.app)â€™s latest update I wanted to create pretty involved animations any while starting on building them I had a though -- a though that usually ends in way too much effort:

> This should be made easier

Every time this thought pops into my head, I end up diving deep into a rabbit hole. This time I allowed myself to get distracted because the idea of making a little animation library sounded like too much fun to pass up on.

## End result

- spoiler, here it is: [AnimationPlanner](https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner)


After shipping the update to OK Video I went back to revisit my library and give it some well-deserved attention. I was gently nudged to try an approach using Swift's result builders and I went for it. Creating a sequence animation in code now looks as simple as:

```swift
AnimationPlanner.plan {
    Animate(duration: 0.32, timingFunction: .quintOut) {
        view.alpha = 1
        view.center.y = self.view.bounds.midY
    }
    Wait(0.2)
    Animate(duration: 0.32) {
        view.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 40
        view.backgroundColor = .systemRed
    }.timingFunction(.quintOut)
    Wait(0.2)
    AnimateSpring(duration: 0.25, damping: 0.52) {
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 0
        view.transform = .identity
    }
    Wait(0.58)
    Animate(duration: 0.2) {
        view.alpha = 0
        view.transform = .identity
        view.frame.origin.y = self.view.bounds.maxY
    }.timingFunction(.circIn)
} completion: { finished in
    view.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

The nice-looking code above results in the following animation sequence. Yes, really.
