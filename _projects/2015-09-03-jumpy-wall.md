Jumpy Wall is my first foray into solo game development, development in 6 months to learn Unity and gain experience with finishing and releasing a project.

- Colorful, fast wall jumping action
- Easy controls: tap to jump, hold to slide
- Unforgivingly difficult obstacles

Wall jump from left to right to get higher and higher while avoiding spikes and collecting gems in this colorful pixel-style action game.
Can you get higher than your friends? Who can make the biggest gem combo?
