Super fast video sequences. Hold the screen to record and quickly make an OK Video montage. Then, send it off to your favorite app, directly to your camera roll, or post it to one of those story apps.

It's an app that lets you capture videos just like Vine, but fullscreen and no time limitations and only the recording part.
